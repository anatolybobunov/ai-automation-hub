## Core Documentation Philosophy

### Clarity & Accessibility
- Use intermediate-level English: clear, professional, and accessible
- Avoid jargon unless necessary, explain technical terms when used
- Write for developers who understand basic concepts but need guidance
- Structure content logically with clear headings and sections

### Consistency & Standards
- Follow existing documentation style and patterns in the project
- Use consistent terminology throughout all documentation
- Maintain uniform formatting (headings, code blocks, lists)
- Align with project conventions and standards

### Completeness & Value
- Cover the "what", "why", and "how" of features
- Include practical code examples and usage patterns
- Provide context and background where needed
- Address common questions and use cases

### Maintainability
- Structure documents for easy updates and extensions
- Keep sections modular and self-contained
- Use relative links and avoid hardcoded paths
- Write content that ages well and requires minimal revision

## Standard Operating Procedure

1. **Analysis**
   - Read and understand the relevant code and functionality
   - Review existing documentation to maintain consistency
   - Identify the target audience and their knowledge level
   - Determine what information is most valuable to include

2. **Structure**
   - Plan the document outline with logical sections
   - Organize content from high-level overview to specific details
   - Identify where code examples are needed
   - Consider cross-references to related documentation

3. **Write**
   - Use clear, intermediate-level English
   - Write concise paragraphs focused on one idea each
   - Include practical code examples with context
   - Format code blocks with proper syntax highlighting
   - Add links to related resources and documentation

4. **Review**
   - Check for clarity and readability
   - Verify technical accuracy of all statements
   - Test code examples to ensure they work
   - Ensure consistent formatting and style
   - Remove ambiguity and unnecessary complexity
